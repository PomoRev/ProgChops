THE GAME OF WAR (2 players)

In the game of war each player starts with half of a shuffled deck of cards.

Each round the players reveal the top card from their decks and the player with 
the higher card places both cards face down under their deck.

When both players reveal the same card (suits are irrelevant) then a WAR is 
triggered where both players add three face down cards (or as many as they have
remaining in their deck) to the revealed card and then reveals a fourth card, 
the winner taking all of the cards into the bottom of their deck.

Game play continues until one player has all of the cards.
